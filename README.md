Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA)
README / Repository Overview
Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA)

Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA) is a method for achieving two independent secrets on the same device and requiring both to be accepted in order to authorize an action.

DSA explores authorization flows where no single secret, device state, or disclosure can complete an action alone.

DSA is presented as a method, not a mandate.
Its value lies in how it may be composed, adapted, or rejected by future systems.

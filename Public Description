Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA)
Public Description
Overview

Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA) is a method for authorizing actions by requiring two independent secrets to be accepted on the same device.

Rather than relying on a single password, factor, or approval step, DSA ensures that no single secret—by itself—can complete an authorization.

What Problem DSA Addresses

Many systems rely on one decisive credential or action. If that single element is compromised, authorization collapses.

DSA explores a different approach:

Two secrets

One device

Both must be satisfied

This reduces risk from partial compromise, coercion, or accidental disclosure.

How DSA Works (Conceptually)

DSA separates acceptance into two distinct requirements.

Examples may include:

A cryptographic secret and a physical interaction

A stored key and a timing-based action

A hardware-bound secret and a locally derived signal

Authorization occurs only when both secrets are accepted.

[ADD COMMENT: Examples are illustrative only; implementations may vary widely.]

What DSA Is (and Is Not)

DSA is:

A method for authorization

Device-centric

Compatible with other security systems

DSA is not:

A password replacement by itself

A biometric system

A network identity service

Example Applications

Hardware security devices

High-risk authorization workflows

Local-only approval systems

Systems requiring resilience to partial compromise

Status

Dual Secret Acceptance is an early-stage method under exploration.

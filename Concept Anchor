Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA)
Concept Anchor
Purpose

This document serves as a conceptual anchor for Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA).

Its role is to define the intent, boundaries, and authorship context of the DSA method without asserting implementation details, performance guarantees, or standardization status.

Definition

Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA) refers to a method for achieving two independent secrets on the same device and requiring both to be accepted in order to authorize an action.

The defining characteristic of DSA is that both secrets exist under shared device custody while remaining deliberately independent in origin, storage, or activation.

Design Intent

DSA is designed to explore:

Authorization without reliance on a single secret

Intentional separation of secrets on one device

Acceptance models resilient to partial disclosure

Local decision-making without mandatory network involvement

DSA intentionally avoids dependence on:

Cloud-mediated identity

Continuous connectivity

Single-point secret disclosure

User identity assumptions

Scope and Boundaries

DSA is a method concept, not a product specification.

This document does not define:

Cryptographic algorithms

Hardware architectures

Secure element requirements

Compliance or certification claims

These elements are considered implementation-specific and out of scope.

Authorship and Origin

The DSA concept originated with lowc (T00LA1D).
Method development powered by Siren intelligence.

This document records early conceptual framing only. It does not assert ownership over implementations or derivatives.

Status

Early conceptual anchor. Subject to revision, expansion,

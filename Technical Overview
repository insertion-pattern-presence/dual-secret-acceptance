Technical Overview
Abstract

Dual Secret Acceptance (DSA) is a method for authorizing actions by requiring the acceptance of two independent secrets residing on the same device. The method emphasizes intentional separation of secrets while maintaining shared device custody.

This document provides a technical overview of the DSA method and its relationship to existing authorization paradigms.

1. Problem Statement

Single-secret authorization models are vulnerable to disclosure, replay, coercion, or misuse.

DSA explores whether requiring two independent acceptances on the same device can meaningfully reduce these risks without introducing excessive user friction.

2. Core Concept

DSA defines authorization as the intersection of two satisfied secrets.

Each secret may differ in:

Origin

Storage location

Activation method

Temporal behavior

The key requirement is independence, not symmetry.

3. Acceptance Model (Illustrative)

An example acceptance flow may include:

Secret A: hardware-backed or firmware-resident

Secret B: derived through local interaction or context

Authorization succeeds only when both are valid.

[ADD COMMENT: Acceptance models are illustrative and not prescriptive.]

4. Security Properties

DSA provides:

Resistance to single-point compromise

Reduced reliance on user memory

Local-only authorization capability

Compatibility with hardware-isolated secrets

DSA does not claim to replace cryptographic verification, but to structure how secrets are jointly required.

5. Relationship to Existing Systems

DSA is conceptually compatible with:

Hardware security modules

Passkey systems

Presence-based signals (e.g., IPP)

DSA differs by focusing on dual acceptance under shared custody, rather than multiple external factors.

6. Implementation Notes

Possible implementations may involve:

Deterministic state machines

Hardware-backed key storage

Local acceptance orchestration

Specific implementations are intentionally left open.

7. Status

This document describes an early-stage method concept.
No claims of compliance, interoperability, or certification are made.

8. Attribution
